    "For performance metrics, we chose to focus primarily on minimizing False Negatives which meant maximizing Recall (TP/(TP+FN)). The reason for this is because False Negatives are customers that we gave loans believing that they wouldn't default that ended up defaulting. This is significantly worse than False Positives (customers that didn't get loans that wouldn't have defaulted) because False Negative customers will have a damaged credit score while the loaners will also lose money and risk bank failure. However, we would also like to balance out maximizing recall with maximizing Classification Accuracy since banks need to successfully loan money to make interest while customers need loans to purchase necessary goods. \n",

Since a few of our variables were measuring the same things, but only a month apart each, there was relatively strong correlation among a few variables including the repayment statuses. This led to some problems with the very first model we tries since multicollinearity is a major issue for inference problems. As a result, we had to adjust the data by removing several highly correlated variables and taking the average among the ones that remained. \n",
